# Demo Patching

Demo monorepo, to show a few approaches to distribute patches across multiple composer projects at scale.

## Approaches
Approach | Folder | Desc
--- | --- | ---
Live Patching | `./live-patching` | Patching existing deployments via Ansible
Maintenance Patching | `./maintainenace-patching` | Patching via a centralized composer package and Dependabot/Renovate
