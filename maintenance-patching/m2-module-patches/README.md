# M2 Module Patches

Demo module to handle ensuring certain patches are applied across multiple projects.

## TODO
- Does it handle absent packages? E.G What if we want to patch a amasty module that is present on a subset of stores?

## Installation

To use this package in a project, you just need to require it.

```sh
composer require acme-agency/m2-module-patches:^1.0
```
